# Pet Shop Truffle Box

This box has all you need to get started with our [Pet Shop tutorial](http://todo).

## Requirements
It has been tested with 
    - node=16
    - yarn=1.22.18

## Installation

1.  Install Dependencies
```
yarn
```
2. Run the `liteserver` development server (outside the development console) for front-end hot reloading. Smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.
    ```javascript
    // Serves the front-end on http://localhost:3000
    npm run dev
    ```

**NOTE**: This box is not a complete dapp, but the starting point for the [Pet Shop tutorial](http://truffleframework.com/tutorial). You'll need to complete that for this to function.
